## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
  - Formulas & Functions  
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Pivot Charts   

## 🎯 Project Focus
The Intermediate level projects aim to practice:
- Lookup and logical functions for analysis
- Dynamic formulas and conditional calculations
- Data aggregation using Pivot Tables
- Analytical visualization

## 📘 Key Skills Practiced
- Lookup & Reference: `VLOOKUP` `AND` `IF`
- Dynamic Arrays: `UNIQUE`, `SORT`, `RANDARRAY`
- Conditional Analysis: `COUNTIF`
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

## 🧹 Data Preparation
Common preprocessing steps include:
- Removing duplicate records
- Data Format Normalization
- Handling missing or blank values - (Input Blank values with date before the blank)
- Standardizing text formats and categories - (Using `TRIM` `PROPER` `SUBSTITUTE`)
- Create "Mapping_Product" files to help standarize words
- Ensuring dataset consistency

## 📊 Project Output & Analysis - Pivot Table & Pivot Chart
The output of these mini projects typically includes:
- **Total Sales per Category**
  - The **Electronics category contributed the highest revenue of IDR 12,935,000**.

- **Total Sales per Date / Trend Chart** <br>

  - The highest peak of the trend was in **February at Rp 10,050,000**.
  - There was a **sharp decline** from April to May **by 66%**.
  - After further analysis, the **decline (*orange dotted line*) occurred due to a lack of data or irregular data duration**. The dataset used ends on **May 10, 2024**, so it can be said that **the data is still ongoing or a forecast**. 
  - After further analysis using **forecasting**, the results show that **in May, sales performance was stable at Rp 9,889,000 or 24%**, and even had the potential to match the sales record in February.<br>

  - A comparative analysis was also conducted for April 1-10 vs. May. The results showed that **total sales in May were higher than in April**.<br>

- **Total Sales High vs Low**
  - From **January to May 2024, approximately 85% of the most popular products were high-priced items**. Consumer interest remained consistent each month, suggesting that high-priced products dominated monthly sales.

- **Total Sales per Region** <br>
    <img width="554" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f43d9e-f92d-4454-b23d-646e88c1819b" />
  - The **highest sales percentage** came from the **West** region, which accounted for **28%** of total sales, followed by the **East, North, and finally South**.

- **Trend Harga Jual (Average per Unit)** <br>
    <img width="553" height="435" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb58b99-0297-416a-9be3-ad01541a802e" />
  - On average, **sales from January to May 2024 increased**, peaking in May at Rp 145,500, meaning that **product sales increased gradually each month** (*orange bar graph*).

- **Total Sales of Each Category per Region**<br>
    <img width="674" height="474" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c1f06e1-1c7b-4990-862e-afe8d2417888" />
  - Judging from the **Sum of Quantity**, the **Accessories** category ranks third in terms of the number of buyers compared to the **Footwear** category, but its total sales are the lowest. This is because the **unit price of Accessories is lower than other categories**, so the graph shows that **Accessories** has the lowest sales.
  - From this, it cannot be said that buyer interest in the **Accessories** category is low in every region. However, we can **increase sales** in this category in several ways, **such as promoting it through social media or launching new products** to attract more customers to purchase items in this category.
